                                            Meet Bad Luck Betty
Dear Diary.
I have the worst luck! What can I do? I can never succeed at anything. Even when I try hard, I feel. If I do my best, somethings still goes wrong.Everyone calls me Bad luck Betty. 
Today, for example. I have have the most awful luck. once again, nothing went right for me. Nothing but bad luck.This morning the weather was nice, so I decided to walk to school. I left early. It was nice when I left, but on the way to school the weather changed.It started to rain really hard. I had no umbrella, so I try to run and find shelter. On the way, I dropped my homework and all my books. Everything got wet. When I finally got to school. All of my teachers gave me Bad grades because I didn't have my homework.
At lunch I talked to Danny Chester.I have like Danny for a long time. I have never asked out a guy before. but today I was feeling brave. I asked him if he wanted to go to the dance with me on Friday. And he said yes! I couldn't believe it. My luck had finally changed. but, of course, it didn't last. In the afternoon they made an announcement that the dance was canceled.
After school, I took the school bus home because it looked like rain again. It didn't rain, but the school bus broke down, and we had to wait for two hours for another one
when I finally got home, there was a message from Danny on my answering machine. His parents have just told him that they are moving to Ireland in two weeks. I'll probably never see him again.
I hate days like today. Will my love ever get better? Or will I always be bad luck Betty?

After 10 minutes, Asha was asked by her father to peel the egg, peel the potato, and strain the leaves. Asha was left confused by her father's order. Her father explained, “Each item was placed into the same circumstance, boiling water. See how each responded differently?” He continued, “The egg was soft, but is now hard. The potato was hard, but is now soft. And the tea leaves, they changed the water itself.” Then, Asha was asked by her father, “When adversity calls, we respond in the same manner as they have. Now, are you an egg, a potato, or tea leaves?” - Contoh 2 There once was a poor boy. His days was spent on the door-to-door selling newspapers to pay for school. One day, as he was walking his route, he started feeling low and weak. His stomach was empty and he was starving. So he decided to ask for food when he came to the next door.

But the boy was asked to just drink the milk without paying. Years later, the girl, who was now a grown woman, fell sick. She was told by the the doctors that she needed an expensive surgery.

One of my friends in my class likes Smoking He never does that at school though. He seems to enjoy that. He sometimes offers his friend some Cigarettes Once he told me that there was nothing wrong for students to smoke.
I was very surprised with his statement then. Until now I am still curious
to know why he could say that. As we know smoking means Spending more money. The question is : Can we make money ? Of course the answer will be not because as students we still Depend our parents on many things. Besides, our main job is studying.
Smoking means inviting Disease There have been many reports and researches informing that smoking can cause many diseases, Heart attack and Lung Cancer may be some of the dangers. They are very serious and Lethal diseases. I think no body will say yes when we ask them wheter they want to suffer from those diseases.
I believe you will share my opinion that smoking gives nothing but Disease. So as students we must stay away from smoking and I think that is the best Choice for us.</a>

                            9. Meet Bad Luck Betty
Dear Diary.
I have the worst luck! What can I do? I can never succeed at anything. Even when I try hard, I feel. If I do my best, somethings still goes wrong.Everyone calls me Bad luck Betty. 
Today, for example. I have have the most awful luck. once again, nothing went right for me. Nothing but bad luck.This morning the weather was nice, so I decided to walk to school. I left early. It was nice when I left, but on the way to school the weather changed.It started to rain really hard. I had no umbrella, so I try to run and find shelter. On the way, I dropped my homework and all my books. Everything got wet. When I finally got to school. All of my teachers gave me Bad grades because I didn't have my homework.
At lunch I talked to Danny Chester.I have like Danny for a long time. I have never asked out a guy before. but today I was feeling brave. I asked him if he wanted to go to the dance with me on Friday. And he said yes! I couldn't believe it. My luck had finally changed. but, of course, it didn't last. In the afternoon they made an announcement that the dance was canceled.
After school, I took the school bus home because it looked like rain again. It didn't rain, but the school bus broke down, and we had to wait for two hours for another one
when I finally got home, there was a message from Danny on my answering machine. His parents have just told him that they are moving to Ireland in two weeks. I'll probably never see him again.
I hate days like today. Will my love ever get better? Or will I always be bad luck Betty?

tolong di jawab.</h2><br />
                        1.told them your feelings. you also have to be more patience and understand them. talk softly each other so they can understand. <br />2.say to her that she shouldn't do that. told that as a lady, she      has duties in home to help you do household chores. <br />3.find friend or someone who could help you. if needed,take a course , so you can understand new loords.<br />4. start  to walk to your school faster. if possible, take a bus , so you won't late.<br />5.start to make some good choices. don't eat junkfood and eat vegetables and fruits.<br />6.told the conditions to your teacher. maybe your school can help you.<br />7.told the problem to your teacher. say to your teacher you don't like when he play tricks to you.<br />8.go to the machine repairer, so he can help you repair your computer.<br />9. take a bus or walk fastly to your school.<br />10.goto hospital and check your grandfather. and buy some medicine to help him go healthier<br />1) you ought to understand the circumstances of your parent, why would they be so busy with their duties. But, parent also should be know about their rule as a guardian in the family. Kids also needs parent's attention so that they could behave in society and has a responsibility.<br /><br />2) you may be better to have a small talk with your sister and give her some advices. Give her some examples, tell her about the casuality of her doing. Because we all knew that going in a pubs also not good. It waste our money and time that actually can be used for our tuition to get a good education or the other example. Make her understand about the meaning of her role in family, helping each other. including the household chores. Because, as time goes by, we'll live alone without some relatives that can be relied on. But, you should talk with her softly so that she wouldn't get mad easily and get to understand you either.<br /><br />3) You shouldn't be frustated first, because when you have no spirit to learn something, then would not get anything too. Love the subject first, find it so interesting, learn something that you loved and realte it with english. for example, if you love listening music then try to listen a foreign music. then you will eventually love english and would like to know the meaning, looking for the meaning in a dictionary so that it can increase your vocabulary, and so on.<br /><br />4) You should try to wake up early than usual knowing that you always come late by 30 minutes. at least wake up 30 minutes early so that you can come on time. If you can't wake up early in the morning then, don't sleep too late in the night. <br /><br />5) You ought to reduce your weight by training or jogging every morning, everyday. Prevent yourself to eat some foods that contains much calories, sweet, and the others that can make you fat. try to eat some vegetable, fruits and do a little diet step by step as long as it's fit in the diet procedure.<br /><br />6) you may talk to your parent first about their economic's condition. if they really couldn't cover up your school fee, try to help your parent by part time job ora for the last case, you should talk to your headmaster or teacher about the right solution so that they can understand your situation and probably it would be good if your teacher really can help you about your school fee<br /><br />7) You should adapt yourself with your surrounding including your friends. if they're really have those kind of personality since they were child then you should understand it. but there also a limitation toward those understanding. if they tease you too much, you should talk to them slowly, and tell that you really find it annoying or pissed you off. probably, your teasing-like friend would understand you.<br /><br />8) You should save some money to take your computer to a service center. try not to give your parent much burden. imagine how hard it is to get money for buying a new one, so try saving up a little of your monthly allowance. then at least you've lift up your parent's burden for getting your laptop serviced. <br /><br />9) You may take another vehicle to go to school. you can go to school by public transportation and wake up early in the morning to prevent a traffic jamp. If you have a friend liveng close by your house, try to ask him so that he can give you a ride to school together. but dont forget your manner to reply him anytime he needs your help.<br /><br />10) You ought to visit him at least. Make him happy, tell him some pleasing stories so that his condition would still be constant and calm. Do not shout or get angry in front of your grandfather knowing that he had a heart attack. and it would have been better if you also could give him some motivations to gain his health back. <br /><br /><br /><strong>*hope it helps you well ^^ sorry for any mistakes. thanks</strong><br /><br />

                            16. - Contoh 1 Once the water was boiling, Asha was ordered by her father to place the items into each pot and keep an eye on them. After 10 minutes, Asha was asked by her father to peel the egg, peel the potato, and strain the leaves. Asha was left confused by her father's order. Her father explained, “Each item was placed into the same circumstance, boiling water. See how each responded differently?” He continued, “The egg was soft, but is now hard. The potato was hard, but is now soft. And the tea leaves, they changed the water itself.” Then, Asha was asked by her father, “When adversity calls, we respond in the same manner as they have. Now, are you an egg, a potato, or tea leaves?” - Contoh 2 There once was a poor boy. His days was spent on the door-to-door selling newspapers to pay for school. One day, as he was walking his route, he started feeling low and weak. His stomach was empty and he was starving. So he decided to ask for food when he came to the next door.

He asked for a glass of water, but seeing his poor state. But, instead of water, the glass of delicious milk was brought by the girl to the starving boy. The boy asked how much he owed the girl. But the boy was asked to just drink the milk without paying. Years later, the girl, who was now a grown woman, fell sick. She was told by the the doctors that she needed an expensive surgery. Finally, she went to the best doctor in town. The girl was successfully cured by a competent doctor. Despite her happiness, she was afraid she couldn’t afford to pay the bill.

                            19. Tolong artikan ini ke bahasa indonesia dengan menggunakan bahasa yang jelas dan mudah di mengerti.
One of my friends in my class likes Smoking He never does that at school though. He seems to enjoy that. He sometimes offers his friend some Cigarettes Once he told me that there was nothing wrong for students to smoke.
I was very surprised with his statement then. Until now I am still curious
to know why he could say that. As we know smoking means Spending more money. The question is : Can we make money ? Of course the answer will be not because as students we still Depend our parents on many things. Besides, our main job is studying.
Smoking means inviting Disease There have been many reports and researches informing that smoking can cause many diseases, Heart attack and Lung Cancer may be some of the dangers. They are very serious and Lethal diseases. I think no body will say yes when we ask them wheter they want to suffer from those diseases.
I believe you will share my opinion that smoking gives nothing but Disease. So as students we must stay away from smoking and I think that is the best Choice for us.</h2><br />
                        Salah satu temanku suka merokok. Akan tetapi dia tidak pernah melakukannya di sekolah. Kelihatannya dia sangat menikmatinya. Terkadang dia menawarkan temannya beberapa butir rokok. Dia pernah mengatakan padaku bahwa tidak ada yang salah jika siswa merokok.<br /><br />Aku sangat terkejut dengan perkataannya. Sampai sekarang aku masih penasaran mengapa dia bisa berkata begitu. Seperti yang kita ketahui, merokok berarti, "Menghabiskan lebih banyak uang." Pertanyaannya adalah : Bisakah kita menghasilkan uang? Jawabannya tentu saja tidak karena sebagai pelajar kita masih bergantung pada orang tua dalam berbagai macam hal. Selain itu, pekerjaan utama kita adalah belajar.<br /><br />Merokok berarti, "Mengundang penyakit." Sudah banyak laporan dan riset yang memberitahukan bahwa merokok bisa menyebabkan banyak penyakit. Serangan jantung dan kanker paru-paru bisa menjadi salah satu akibatnya. Mereka sangat serius dan mematikan. Aku pikir tidak akan ada yang bilang, "Ya" ketika kita menawarkan mereka apakah mereka ingin menderita oleh penyakit tsb atau tidak.<br /><br />Aku percaya kamu akan membagikan pendapatku kalau merokok tidak memberikan apa-apa kecuali penyakit. Jadi sebagai pelajar kita harus menghindari merokok dan aku pikir itulah pilihan terbaik untuk kita.<br />
