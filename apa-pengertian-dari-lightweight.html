                                            Squid-inspired robot swims with nature's most efficient marine animals
Scientists at the University of Southampton and University of Edinburgh have developed a flexible underwater robot that can propel itself through water in the same style as nature's most efficient swimmer -- the Aurelia aurita jellyfish.
The findings, published in Science Robotics, demonstrate that the new underwater robot can swim as quickly and efficiently as the squid and jellyfish which inspired its design, potentially unlocking new possibilities for underwater exploration with its lightweight design and soft exterior.
(1) Co-author Dr Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, Lecturer and Chancellor's Fellow, at the School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, said: (2) "The fascination for organisms such as squid, jellyfish and octopuses has been growing enormously because they are quite unique in that their lack of
    supportive skeletal structure does not prevent them from outstanding feats of swimming."
The new robot was developed at the University of Southampton and is the first submersible to demonstrate the benefits of using resonance for underwater propulsion. Resonance refers to large vibrations that occur when applying a force at the ideal frequency, like pushing a child on a swing. This allows the robot to use very little power but generate large water jets to push itself forward.
(3) The simple but effective mechanism consists of rubber membrane enclosing eight 3D-printed flexible ribs, which together form a 'propulsive bell'. (4) First , a small piston in the top half of the robot taps this bell repeatedly so that it expands and then springs back. This mimics a jellyfish's swimming technique and produced the jets of fluid to propel the robot through the water. When the piston operates at with the correct frequency, the robot can move at one body length per second and match the efficiency of the Aurella aurita jellyfish.

In the solved condition, Rubik’s cube has six faces which all of the colors are same. The Rubik's cube has red, yellow, blue, green, white, and orange color. The edges and corners move when the cube is rotated and the cube becomes scrambled. The challenge of the puzzle is to solve each cube to the original position.
There are many solutions to solve the Rubik’s cube. Lars Petrus, Jessica Fridich, and Shotaro Makisumi, are people who created the solution to solve it. A common solution used by cubers was developed by Jessica Fridrich, a professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University. It uses a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross consists of one color is done first and then continue to make second and first layer by F2L (First 2 Layer) algorithms that consist of 41 algorithms. The next step is to solve the third layer by OLL (Oriented Last Layer) and PLL (Permutation Last Layer). Fridrich's solution requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but the Cube can be solved in only 55 moves on average.
There are two kinds of Rubik’s cube, DIY and Original Rubik’s cube. DIY (Do It Yourself) Rubik’s cube is the cube that can be assembled and modified by ourselves. The core of it made up of bolts; so we can arrange the bolts to get a comfortable Rubik’s cube. Types of DIY Rubik’s cube are, A type, C type, and F type. Every type has different advantages for cubers. For the example, F type is a lightweight Rubik’s cube and it almost can’t be pop out. It is suitable for a stylish cuber. C type has a good material and it suitable for a rush cuber. The second type is Original Rubik’s cube or we can call Ori Rubik. Ori Rubik is the cube that can’t be assembled or modified by ourselves. The core of this made of nails. Ori Rubik is suitable for a beginner cuber that’s training their fingertrick. </a>

With the subsequent incorporation of lightweight wonder materials such as carbon fibre and Kevlar, two years later the newly developed Gossamer Albatross achieved what was hither to thought impossible, and crossed 22 miles of the English Channel at an average height of just five feet!
After more successes in the mid-80 s, an American craft, Daedelus, named after Icarus’s dad and piloted by a Greek cycling champ, flew more than 70 miles over the Mediterranean Sea in just under four hours, earning their creators the records for both the furthest distance flown and the longest flight duration,despite the fact that a headwind caused the plane to ditch in the sea just yards away from our intended landing point.</a>

The sea turties have a lifespan ranging between 60 and 70 years.Other common turtles have a lifespan ranging between 20 and 40 years. The tortoises, on the other hand, live much longer exceeding 80 years, and some have been known to live up to 150 years.

1.  Two inventors believed that Americans would welcome the opportunity to have a gasmask. They invented one that is part of a baseball cap. 
2. Professional gas masks are costly, heavy, and hard to use. Most consumers would not find them
appealing.
3. The new baseball-cap gas mask is small and lightweight. It can fit in the corner of a drawer, in a coat pocket, or in a briefcase. 
4. This mask can easily fit children as well as adults. It may sell for as little as twenty dollars.
5. The wearer slips a thin sheet of transparent plastic attached to the hat over his or her head. The plastic sheet can be tied shut at the back of the neck.
6. Air from the outside is pulled in by a tiny fan. The air is forced through a filter of activated carbon in the hat's brim.
7. The inventors say that the plastic sheet allows the wearer to see clearly. It does not make the wearer feel too closed in.
8. The mask is not intended for long-term use. It is meant to be worn for about fifteen to thirty minutes.
9. The goal is to allow the wearer to get out of the contaminated area quickly. The wearer can simply slip on the mask and then move into fresh air. 
10. The inventors are now looking for a company to make the new gas mask. Consumers will be able to obtain the gas masks from the manufacturer</a>

                                            Picture of Orchid. Orchid is one of ornamental plants in the form of parasite. It has been known since 200 years ago but it has been cultivated in Indonesia since last 50 years. They mostly found in the tropical area. Based on the nature of their life, it can be divided into three groups, namely Ephytis, Semi Ephytis, and Terrestris. Ephytis is the orchid which lives on other plants. Semi Ephytis is the orchid which lives on the other plants but do not damage the main plant. While Terrestrial is the orchid which grows on the ground. They have beautiful and unique flowers that are different from others. It arranged as a compound system appearing from its stalk. This flower shaped as a bilateral symmetry. Its petals have the same color with the crown. The leaves are quite thick and usually elongated oval. Its thick leaves serves to store water. Its stem is jointed and thick. This stem is coated by wax layer which serves to prevent water evaporation. It has green fruit and shaped like a capsule. Inside its fruit, there are seeds which are very small and lightweight so it is easy to get carried away by the wind to the other places. Its seed will only grow if stick in the appropriate media because they do not have a storage to keep reserves food. They have so many types with variety of shapes and colors. The types of them such as: Vanda or also known as a cut flower; orchid which has a great flower known as Grammatophyllum; orchid soil or Spathyphyllum and others. Besides as ornamental plants, they can also be used as a mixture of herbs, ingredients perfume or hair oils. They will grow well when exposed to sufficient sunlight and have a lot of food sources. The media used to plant them are charcoal and brick for ephytis orchid and semi ephytis, compost and chaff for terrestrial orchids, while broken tiles and chaff are the media for semi terrestrial orchid.

                                            Refer to the following passage for questions 40-45.Many great inventions are initially greeted with ridicule and disbelief. The invention of the airplane was no exception. Although many people who heard about the first powered flight on December 17, 1903 were excited and impressed, others reacted with peals of laughter. The idea of flying an aircraft was repulsive to some people. Such people called Wilbur and Orville Wright, the inventors of the first flying machine, impulsive fools. Negative reactions, however, did not stop the Wrights. Impelled by their desire to succeed, they continued their experiments in aviation.Orville and Wilbur Wright had always had a compelling interest in aeronautics and mechanics. As young boys they earned money by making and selling kites and mechanical toys. Later, they designed a newspaper-folding machine, built a printing press, and operated a bicycle-repair shop. In 1896, when they read about the death of Otto Lilienthal, the brothers' interest in flight grew into a compulsion.Lilienthal, a pioneer in hang-gliding, had controlled his gliders by shifting his body in the desired direction. This idea was repellent to the Wright brothers, however, and they searched for more efficient methods to control the balance of airborne vehicles. In 1900 and 1901, the Wrights tested numerous gliders and developed control techniques. The brothers' inability to obtain enough lift power for the gliders almost led them to abandon their efforts.After further study, the Wright brothers concluded that the published tables of air pressure on curved surfaces must be wrong. They set up a wind tunnel and began a series of experiments with model wings. Because of their efforts, the old tables were repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable figures for air pressure on curved surfaces. This work, in turn, made it possible for the brothers to design a machine that would fly. In 1903 the Wrights built their first airplane, which cost less than $1,000. They even designed and built their own source of propulsion-a lightweight gasoline engine. When they started the engine on December 17, the airplane pulsated wildly before taking off. The plane managed to stay aloft for 12 seconds, however, and it flew 120 feet.By 1905, the Wrights had perfected the first airplane that could turn, circle, and remain airborne for half an hour at a time. Others had flown in balloons and hang gliders, but the Wright brothers were the first to build a full-size machine that could fly under its own power. As the contributors of one of the most outstanding engineering achievements in history, the Wright brothers are accurately called the fathers of aviation.40.

AND STILL CHAMPION: 
World Boxing Association featherweight champion Chris "the Dragon" John successfully defended his belt for the ninth time with a technical knock out of Roinet Caballero of Panama on Saturday at Bung Karno Indoor Stadium in Senayan, Central Jakarta. 
Caballero's ring threw in the towel before the start of the eighth round, signaling that their fighter was unable to continue. 
"I want to thank Jesus Christ and Mother Mary as it's because of their blessings my hard training bore fruit," Chris said in a post-fight speech. 
"For the next bout, I leave it to my management to plan. Hopefully, I can have the next bout overseas," the 28-year-old said. 
Chris dominated the Panamanian from the first round, with a combination of powerful punches and solid defense. 
In the third round, Chris had several chances to floor the 24-year-old Caballero, connecting with hooks and upper cuts to the jaw of the challenger, who fired very little in reply. 
Chris kept up the pressure and in the sixth round unleashed a flurry of punches to put the challenger down. 
Caballero tried to fight back in the seventh round, but Chris' defense was simply too solid. The Panamanian was unable to continue the bout, which was scheduled for 12 rounds. 
With the victory, Chris stretched his record to 47 wins, no defeats and one draw, with 21 KOs and one TKO. 
Chris received Rp 2 billion (US$215,000) for the fight, while Caballero earned Rp 650 million. 
On the undercard, lightweight Alex Bajawa of Indonesia was knocked out by Saddam Kietyongyuth of Thailand in the fifth round. Another Indonesian boxer, Andreas Seran, defeated Sam Setu of Samoa by KO in the first round of their scheduled four-round fight. (JP/dre/trw)

Airplanes are heavier than air, in contrast to vehicles such as balloons and airships, which are lighter than air. Airplanes are adapted to specialized uses. Today there are land planes (aircraft that take off from and land on the ground), seaplanes (aircraftthat take off from and land on water), amphibians (aircraft that can operate on both land and sea), and airplanes that can leave the ground using the jet thrust of their engines or rotors (rotating wings) and then switch to wing-borne (2) ...

In addition to balancing lift, weight, thrust, and drag, modern airplanes have to contend with another phenomenon.

In some cases, pilots lost control of the aircraft as shock waves built up on controlsurfaces, effectively locking the controls and leaving the crews helpless. After World War Il, designers tackled the realm of supersonic flight, primarily for military airplanes, but with commercial (6)... as well.

                            5. Squid-inspired robot swims with nature's most efficient marine animals
Scientists at the University of Southampton and University of Edinburgh have developed a flexible underwater robot that can propel itself through water in the same style as nature's most efficient swimmer -- the Aurelia aurita jellyfish.
The findings, published in Science Robotics, demonstrate that the new underwater robot can swim as quickly and efficiently as the squid and jellyfish which inspired its design, potentially unlocking new possibilities for underwater exploration with its lightweight design and soft exterior.
(1) Co-author Dr Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, Lecturer and Chancellor's Fellow, at the School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, said: (2) "The fascination for organisms such as squid, jellyfish and octopuses has been growing enormously because they are quite unique in that their lack of
    supportive skeletal structure does not prevent them from outstanding feats of swimming."
The new robot was developed at the University of Southampton and is the first submersible to demonstrate the benefits of using resonance for underwater propulsion. Resonance refers to large vibrations that occur when applying a force at the ideal frequency, like pushing a child on a swing. This allows the robot to use very little power but generate large water jets to push itself forward.
(3) The simple but effective mechanism consists of rubber membrane enclosing eight 3D-printed flexible ribs, which together form a 'propulsive bell'. (4) First , a small piston in the top half of the robot taps this bell repeatedly so that it expands and then springs back. This mimics a jellyfish's swimming technique and produced the jets of fluid to propel the robot through the water. When the piston operates at with the correct frequency, the robot can move at one body length per second and match the efficiency of the Aurella aurita jellyfish.

Rubik’s cube
Rubik's cube is a toy puzzle designed by Erno Rubik, an architect and professor at the University of Budapest. It is a cube-shaped and contains of smaller cube pieces with six sides having different colors. The cube was so popular during the 1980s, and at its peak between 1980 and 1983. 200 million cubes were sold world wide. In the solved condition, Rubik’s cube has six faces which all of the colors are same. The Rubik's cube has red, yellow, blue, green, white, and orange color. The edges and corners move when the cube is rotated and the cube becomes scrambled. The challenge of the puzzle is to solve each cube to the original position.
There are many solutions to solve the Rubik’s cube. Lars Petrus, Jessica Fridich, and Shotaro Makisumi, are people who created the solution to solve it. A common solution used by cubers was developed by Jessica Fridrich, a professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University. It uses a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross consists of one color is done first and then continue to make second and first layer by F2L (First 2 Layer) algorithms that consist of 41 algorithms. The next step is to solve the third layer by OLL (Oriented Last Layer) and PLL (Permutation Last Layer). Fridrich's solution requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but the Cube can be solved in only 55 moves on average.
There are two kinds of Rubik’s cube, DIY and Original Rubik’s cube. DIY (Do It Yourself) Rubik’s cube is the cube that can be assembled and modified by ourselves. The core of it made up of bolts; so we can arrange the bolts to get a comfortable Rubik’s cube. Types of DIY Rubik’s cube are, A type, C type, and F type. Every type has different advantages for cubers. For the example, F type is a lightweight Rubik’s cube and it almost can’t be pop out. It is suitable for a stylish cuber. C type has a good material and it suitable for a rush cuber. The second type is Original Rubik’s cube or we can call Ori Rubik. Ori Rubik is the cube that can’t be assembled or modified by ourselves. The core of this made of nails. Ori Rubik is suitable for a beginner cuber that’s training their fingertrick. </h2><br />

Airplanes are heavier than air, in contrast to vehicles sand airships, which are lighter than air. Airplanes are adapted to specialized uses. Today there are land planes (aircraft that take off from and land on the ground), seaplanes (aircraft that take off from and land on water), amphibians (aircraft that can operate on both land and sea), and airplanes that can leave the ground using the jet thrust of their engines or rotorsrotating wings) and then switch to wing-borne (2) ...     An airplane flies because its wings create lift, the upward (3) ... on the plane, as they interact with the flow of air around them. The wings alter the direction of the flow of air as it passes. The exact shape of the surface of a wing is critical to its ability to generate lift.

It has been known since 200 years ago but it has been cultivated in Indonesia since last 50 years. They mostly found in the tropical area. Based on the nature of their life, it can be divided into three groups, namely Ephytis, Semi Ephytis, and Terrestris. Ephytis is the orchid which lives on other plants. Semi Ephytis is the orchid which lives on the other plants but do not damage the main plant. While Terrestrial is the orchid which grows on the ground. They have beautiful and unique flowers that are different from others. It arranged as a compound system appearing from its stalk. This flower shaped as a bilateral symmetry. Its petals have the same color with the crown. The leaves are quite thick and usually elongated oval. Its thick leaves serves to store water. Its stem is jointed and thick. This stem is coated by wax layer which serves to prevent water evaporation. It has green fruit and shaped like a capsule. Inside its fruit, there are seeds which are very small and lightweight so it is easy to get carried away by the wind to the other places. Its seed will only grow if stick in the appropriate media because they do not have a storage to keep reserves food. They have so many types with variety of shapes and colors. The types of them such as: Vanda or also known as a cut flower; orchid which has a great flower known as Grammatophyllum; orchid soil or Spathyphyllum and others. Besides as ornamental plants, they can also be used as a mixture of herbs, ingredients perfume or hair oils. They will grow well when exposed to sufficient sunlight and have a lot of food sources. The media used to plant them are charcoal and brick for ephytis orchid and semi ephytis, compost and chaff for terrestrial orchids, while broken tiles and chaff are the media for semi terrestrial orchid.

                            21. Refer to the following passage for questions 40-45.Many great inventions are initially greeted with ridicule and disbelief. The invention of the airplane was no exception. Although many people who heard about the first powered flight on December 17, 1903 were excited and impressed, others reacted with peals of laughter. The idea of flying an aircraft was repulsive to some people. Such people called Wilbur and Orville Wright, the inventors of the first flying machine, impulsive fools. Negative reactions, however, did not stop the Wrights. Impelled by their desire to succeed, they continued their experiments in aviation.Orville and Wilbur Wright had always had a compelling interest in aeronautics and mechanics. As young boys they earned money by making and selling kites and mechanical toys. Later, they designed a newspaper-folding machine, built a printing press, and operated a bicycle-repair shop. In 1896, when they read about the death of Otto Lilienthal, the brothers' interest in flight grew into a compulsion.Lilienthal, a pioneer in hang-gliding, had controlled his gliders by shifting his body in the desired direction. This idea was repellent to the Wright brothers, however, and they searched for more efficient methods to control the balance of airborne vehicles. In 1900 and 1901, the Wrights tested numerous gliders and developed control techniques. The brothers' inability to obtain enough lift power for the gliders almost led them to abandon their efforts.After further study, the Wright brothers concluded that the published tables of air pressure on curved surfaces must be wrong. They set up a wind tunnel and began a series of experiments with model wings. Because of their efforts, the old tables were repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable figures for air pressure on curved surfaces. This work, in turn, made it possible for the brothers to design a machine that would fly. In 1903 the Wrights built their first airplane, which cost less than $1,000. They even designed and built their own source of propulsion-a lightweight gasoline engine. When they started the engine on December 17, the airplane pulsated wildly before taking off. The plane managed to stay aloft for 12 seconds, however, and it flew 120 feet.By 1905, the Wrights had perfected the first airplane that could turn, circle, and remain airborne for half an hour at a time. Others had flown in balloons and hang gliders, but the Wright brothers were the first to build a full-size machine that could fly under its own power. As the contributors of one of the most outstanding engineering achievements in history, the Wright brothers are accurately called the fathers of aviation.40.

AND STILL CHAMPION: 
World Boxing Association featherweight champion Chris "the Dragon" John successfully defended his belt for the ninth time with a technical knock out of Roinet Caballero of Panama on Saturday at Bung Karno Indoor Stadium in Senayan, Central Jakarta. 
Caballero's ring threw in the towel before the start of the eighth round, signaling that their fighter was unable to continue. 
"I want to thank Jesus Christ and Mother Mary as it's because of their blessings my hard training bore fruit," Chris said in a post-fight speech. 
"For the next bout, I leave it to my management to plan. Hopefully, I can have the next bout overseas," the 28-year-old said. 
Chris dominated the Panamanian from the first round, with a combination of powerful punches and solid defense. 
In the third round, Chris had several chances to floor the 24-year-old Caballero, connecting with hooks and upper cuts to the jaw of the challenger, who fired very little in reply. 
Chris kept up the pressure and in the sixth round unleashed a flurry of punches to put the challenger down. 
Caballero tried to fight back in the seventh round, but Chris' defense was simply too solid. The Panamanian was unable to continue the bout, which was scheduled for 12 rounds. 
With the victory, Chris stretched his record to 47 wins, no defeats and one draw, with 21 KOs and one TKO. 
Chris received Rp 2 billion (US$215,000) for the fight, while Caballero earned Rp 650 million. 
On the undercard, lightweight Alex Bajawa of Indonesia was knocked out by Saddam Kietyongyuth of Thailand in the fifth round. Another Indonesian boxer, Andreas Seran, defeated Sam Setu of Samoa by KO in the first round of their scheduled four-round fight. (JP/dre/trw)

Airplanes are heavier than air, in contrast to vehicles such as balloons and airships, which are lighter than air. Airplanes are adapted to specialized uses. Today there are land planes (aircraft that take off from and land on the ground), seaplanes (aircraftthat take off from and land on water), amphibians (aircraft that can operate on both land and sea), and airplanes that can leave the ground using the jet thrust of their engines or rotors (rotating wings) and then switch to wing-borne (2) ...

In addition to balancing lift, weight, thrust, and drag, modern airplanes have to contend with another phenomenon. The sound barrier is not a physical barrier but a speed at which the behavior of the airflow around an airplane changes dramatically. Fighter pilots in World War Il (1939-1945) first ran up against this so-called barrier in high-speed dives during (5) ... combat. In some cases, pilots lost control of the aircraft as shock waves built up on controlsurfaces, effectively locking the controls and leaving the crews helpless. After World War Il, designers tackled the realm of supersonic flight, primarily for military airplanes, but with commercial (6)... as well.
